# boundaries

Yet another useless Package Manager for Linux. It uses archives of the application and a json File containing the information that boundaries needs.

# Usage
For installing an Application just run "boundaries -i <path to archive or dir>" or "boundaries --install <path to archive or dir>".

For running an Application from the Terminal Run the following command:
"boundaries -r <app name>" or "boundaries --run <app name>"
